##YAML document to outline deleted/alternate scenes and their timestamps

  #EXAMPLE 1: single scene
    # - start: *start timestamp*
    #   end: *end timestamp*

  #EXAMPLE 2: deleted scene
    # - alternatives:
    #   - name: *name of deleted scene*
    #   - from: original
    #     start: none
    #     end: none
    #
    #   - from: special
    #     start: *start timestamp in director's cut edition*
    #     end: *end timestamp in director's cut edition*

  #EXAMPLE 3: alternate scene
    # - alternatives:
    #   - name: *name of alternate scene*
