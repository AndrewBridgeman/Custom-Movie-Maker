##YAML document to outline deleted/alternate scenes and their timestamps
scene-times:
  #path to original, unedited video
  from-original: files/original.mp4

  #path to "special edition" video with deleted/alternate scenes
  from-special: files/special.mp4

  #name of final outputted video
  to: final.mp4

  #name of single scenes that will be outputted during cutting
  single-scene-name: x{}out.mp4

  #name of alternate scenes that will be outputted from original file during cutting
  original-alternate-name: x{}original-alternate.mp4

  #name of alternate scenes that will be outputted from special file during cutting
  special-alternate-name: x{}special-alternate.mp4

  #name of deleted scenes that will be outputted during cutting
  deleted-name: x{}deleted.mp4


  ##list of scenes that will be cut

  #EXAMPLE 1: single scene
    # - start: *start timestamp*
    #   end: *end timestamp*
  #EXAMPLE 2: deleted scene
    # - deleted:
    #   special-start: *start timestamp in special video*
    #   special-end: *end timestamp in special video*
  #EXAMPLE 3: alternate scene
    # - alternate:
    #   start: *start timestamp in original video*
    #   end: *end timestamp in original video*
    #
    #   special-start: *start timestamp in special video*
    #   special-end: *end timestamp in special video*

  #timestamps are written as hh:mm:ss

  #if a scene continues from an earlier cut, continue
  #can be written instead of the prior timestamp
