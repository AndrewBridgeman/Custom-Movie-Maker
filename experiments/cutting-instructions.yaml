##YAML document to outline deleted/alternate scenes and their timestamps
scene-times:
  #path to master video
  from: files/test1.mp4

  #name of single scenes that will be outputted during cutting
  single-scene-name: x{}out.mp4

  #name of alternate scenes that will be outputted during cutting
  alternate-name: x{}alternate.mp4


  ##list of scenes that will be cut

  #EXAMPLE 1: single scene
    # - start: *start timestamp*
    #   end: *end timestamp*
  #EXAMPLE 2: deleted scene
    # - deleted:
    #   from: *path to deleted scene*
  #EXAMPLE 3: alternate scene
    # - alternate:
    #   start: *start timestamp*
    #   end: *end timestamp*
    #   from: *path to deleted scene*

  #timestamps are written as hh:mm:ss

  #if a scene continues from an earlier cut, continue
  #can be written instead of the prior timestamp
